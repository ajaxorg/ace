This dictionary is based on a subset of the original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for Pspell and  Aspell and thus is covered by his original LGPL license.  The affix file is a heavily modified version of the original english.aff file which was released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell and as such is covered by his BSD license.

Thanks to both authors for their wonderful work.

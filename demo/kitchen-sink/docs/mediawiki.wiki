'''Ace''' is a standalone code editor written in [[wikipedia:JavaScript|JavaScript]]. Our goal is to create a browser based editor that matches and extends the features, usability and performance of existing native editors such as TextMate, Vim or Eclipse. It can be ''easily'' embedded in any web page or JavaScript application. Ace is developed as the primary editor for [http://www.cloud9ide.com/ Cloud9 IDE] and the successor of the Mozilla Skywriter (Bespin) Project.

* Fully customizable key bindings including VI and Emacs modes
* Themes (TextMate themes can be imported)
* Search and replace with regular expressions
* Highlight matching parentheses
* Toggle between soft tabs and real tabs
* Displays hidden characters
* Drag and drop text using the mouse

Contributing

Ace is a community project and wouldn't be what it is without contributions! We actively encourage and support contributions. The Ace source code is released under the BSD License. This license is very simple, and is friendly to all kinds of projects, whether open source or not. Take charge of your editor and add your favorite language highlighting and keybindings!

Feel free to fork and improve/enhance Ace any way you want. If you feel that the editor or the Ace community will benefit from your changes, please open a pull request. To protect the interests of the Ace contributors and users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is the simplest of agreements, requiring that the contributions you make to an ajax.org project are only those you're allowed to make. This helps us significantly reduce future legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes ten minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

There are two versions of the agreement:

1. [The Individual CLA](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/raw/master/doc/Contributor_License_Agreement-v2.pdf): use this version if you're working on an ajax.org in your spare time, or can clearly claim ownership of copyright in what you'll be submitting.
2. [The Corporate CLA](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/raw/master/doc/Corporate_Contributor_License_Agreement-v2.pdf): have your corporate lawyer review and submit this if your company is going to be contributing to ajax.org  projects

If you want to contribute to an ajax.org project please print the CLA and fill it out and sign it. Then either send it by snail mail or fax to us or send it back scanned (or as a photo) by email.
